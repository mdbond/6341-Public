USAGE

  grade.sh SUBMISSION_TGZ REF_IMPL TESTCASE_LIST TESTCASE_DIR

- SUBMISSION_TGZ is the submitted .tgz

- REF_IMPL is the script to run the Quandary reference implementation (used for comparison purposes)

- TESTCASE_LIST is a text file that specifies a test case on each line the following format:

  POINTS PROGRAM INPUT 

  where POINTS is the number of points the test case is worth,
        PROGRAM is the file containing the Quandary program (located in TESTCASE_DIR), and
        INPUT is the integer input to the program.

- TESTCASE_DIR is the location of the program files listed TESTCASE_LIST

Make sure JFLEX_DIR and CUP_DIR are set correctly for your system before running grade.sh.

EXAMPLE

Here's an example run that should work from 6341-Public/quandary if you provide it myproject.tgz:

  grading/grade.sh skeleton/myproject.tgz ref/quandary grading/testcases-example.dat examples

The file *-example.dat files give test cases for which each project should execute correctly.
The point values are made up.
